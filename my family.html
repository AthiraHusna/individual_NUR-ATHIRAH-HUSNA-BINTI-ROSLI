                    <p>There is nothings special that i can share regarding my family since my parents divorced. They started to go separated when i was in form 3. I learned a lot on how to be strong and hide my feelings so that i could be the strength in the family. I was raised by my grandmother and grandfather since i was borned. To be honest, my grandparents are closed to me rather than my own parents. My dad started to dissapeared after the divorced amd a year after my mother remarried again. My family become complete just like other family but for me it was not the same. Being with my biological father and my step father are so different. I can say that i am closed to my biological father than my step father, so it was kind of awkward. I learned to be an independent women after i finished my secondary school. I started to find my own money so that i won't be a burden to my family. My family is not as complete as other family but it was enough for me. I am truly grateful for what i have right now and appreciate every memories that i have with them. </p>
                <br>
                
                <p>So, apprently i have 4 siblings and i am the third child in the family. My first sister currently are working right now in finance department at Ipoh Parade Mall. My second brother also currently are working as editor and my youngest sister is still in primary school at Sk Tasek Dermawan. My mother is working as a chief clerk in Sk Tambun Ipoh.</p>
